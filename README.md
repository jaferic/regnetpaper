# Design Spaces (RegNet) paper from scratch
This repo is my take on the RegNet paper.

Things to keep in mind. The quantized linear model is a simple linear regression on accuracy.
This model focuses on MNIST classification problem
I added more spaces choices from the original paper to see what would happen, interestingly it works but has some caveats and checks added, specially in the Kernel size (while the paper kept it fixed)
